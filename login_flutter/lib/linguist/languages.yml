# Defines all Languages known to GitHub.
#
# All languages have an associated lexer for syntax highlighting. It
# defaults to name.downcase, which covers most cases.
#
# type              - Either data, programming, markup, or nil
# lexer             - An explicit lexer String (defaults to name)
# aliases           - An Array of additional aliases (implicitly
#                     includes name.downcase)
# ace_mode          - A String name of Ace Mode (if available)
# wrap              - Boolean wrap to enable line wrapping (default: false)
# extension         - An Array of associated extensions
# primary_extension - A String for the main extension associated with
#                     the language. Must be unique. Used when a Language is picked
#                     from a dropdown and we need to automatically choose an
#                     extension.
# searchable        - Boolean flag to enable searching (defaults to true)
# search_term       - Deprecated: Some languages maybe indexed under a
#                     different alias. Avoid defining new exceptions.
# color             - CSS hex color to represent the language.
#
# Any additions or modifications (even trivial) should have corresponding
# test change in `test/test_blob.rb`.
#
# Please keep this list alphabetized. Capitalization comes before lower case.
